## Overview
This project is a custom web-based solution designed to modernize and digitize paper-based processes in a clinical setting. It focuses on two main components:

1. **Client Intake Form System** – a secure and accessible platform for capturing and storing new and existing client information.  
2. **Electronic Health Records (EHR) Management System** – a digital records system that enables staff to view, update, and manage client treatment histories.

The system is intended to fully integrate with existing scheduling, booking, and CRM systems, creating a seamless digital workflow and reducing the reliance on manual paperwork.
